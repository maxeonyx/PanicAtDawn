Survival horror co-op mod: stay close to your partner, no recall/mirror, and be home by dawn or die.

Features (all configurable):
- Sanity: stray too far from teammates and sanity drains. At zero, you panic and take damage until you die. Stay near your bed spawn or an active pylon to recover.
- No Recall: Magic Mirror and Recall Potions are converted to Wormhole Potions - your emergency regroup tool.
- Die at Dawn: when the sun rises, if you're not near your bed spawn or an active pylon, you die and drop your inventory.

Perfect for a tense co-op experience with your friends!

For random boss fight modifiers, pair with the Boss Hexes mod.
